# v0lt4

This repository, titled **v0lt4**, represents one of my earliest projects in web development. Using a template as a foundation, I customized it with my own information and design, allowing me to explore and practice essential skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

## Project Description

The project, nicknamed "fotos," was created as an experimental website to learn and implement basic web development concepts. It served as a playground for understanding front-end and back-end development, as well as styling and interactivity.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core interactivity and dynamic behavior.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout customization.
- **HTML**: Structural foundation of the project.
- **PHP**: Minimal server-side logic.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on **GitHub Pages**. You can view it live [here](https://Voltios.github.io/v0lt4).

## Purpose

This project was primarily aimed at learning and experimenting with web development. It highlights the initial steps of my journey as a developer and demonstrates how I adapted and built upon a given template to make it my own.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the original template creators for providing a foundation to build upon.
- Gratitude to everyone who supported me in my early web development journey.
